                <p>"This pandemic,” he continues, “young people can get it and they can transmit it to old people.”
                    The dirty truth about washing your hands. What is the difference between Covid-19 and the common
                    cold and flu? Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu? The UK government’s four
                    stages of fighting coronavirus explained. What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it
                    spread? "The next thing you know,” DeVito said, before mimicking the sound of a broken neck, “I’m
                    outta there!” “Please, do us a favour, all of us, and stay home and not spread this virus around.”
                    Robert De Niro was also called upon by Cuomo to record his own message, in which he references a
                    famous line from his hit comedy Meet the Parents. “We need to stop the spread of the virus,” DeNiro
                    says, adding: “I’m watching you.”</p>

                    <p>"A petition created in support of Danny DeVito becoming the next Wolverine has surpassed 20,000
                        signatures. Although the character has been played so far on the big screen by Hugh Jackman, the
                        actor officially retired the character in 2017’s Logan, and rumours about his replacement have
                        been persistent ever since. In a petition on change.org, user Ring Arius wrote: “The only man
                        able to take the throne after Hugh Jackman. We believe that if Wolverine is to make an
                        appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that the only man able to pull it off is Danny
                        DeVito.”</p>

                        But a mere utensil is not enough to hold Jennifer Lopez’s attention for long. Soon, J-Lo swings back around to return her focus to A-Rod. Their engagement is on deck, after all.</p>
