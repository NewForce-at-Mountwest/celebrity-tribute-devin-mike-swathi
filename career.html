            <article>
                <div class="info-container">A young Danny Devito grew up on a rice farm in the swamps of New Orleans.
                    Due to his geographic location, he became an avid alligator wrestler. This became his love, his
                    passion and nothing else mattered to him while he was dancing with the Devil, going toe-to-toe with
                    these reptillious creatures. It came to be that crowds from Baton Rouge and New Orleans would pour
                    in these swampy rice farms to watch young Danny tame these wild beats with unadulterated speed,
                    violence and momentum. A talent agent from LA stumbled upon this exhibition while visiting the area
                    for Mardi Gras. After witnessing the spectacle, with tears in his eyes from what he had just saw, he
                    asked Danny if he would like to become a movie star.</div>
